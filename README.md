The first true JavaScript assignment for The Iron Yard, the Color Clock was an assignment to create a clock that displays the current time, and while displaying the current time - converting the time into a hex color that displays on the screen. Also, on hover, the time should display the color currently being rendered. Also we were asked to create a progress bar that grew each minute and then restarted.

For a more dramatic effect, I created a gradient using a cascade of the time generated hex colors.
